## VQSVD â€“ Variational Quantum Singular Value Decomposition

VQSVD (Variational Quantum Singular Value Decomposition) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to approximate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix using quantum circuits.

It leverages a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) to represent the singular vectors and uses a classical optimizer to minimize a cost function related to the reconstruction of the matrix. VQSVD is inspired by variational algorithms like VQE and is well-suited for near-term quantum devices (NISQ).
